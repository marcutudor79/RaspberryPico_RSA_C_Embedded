## Description
This code runs bare metal on Raspi Pi Pico.
<p>It collects data via I2C from an accelerometer / magnetometer</p>
<p>It also measures 2 suspension sensors</p>
<p>Parses data and sends it via CAN BUS</p>

<p>This is the accelerometer / magnetometer module which will be on the bottom part of the pcb</p>

<p>This is the can trasciever which will be on the upper part on the PCB, on the backside, in order to save some space</p>

<p>This is the RJ-45 THD connector which will on the most upper side of the PCB, you can see the holes in which it will reside</p>
<p>I also finished the design of the PCB for this module</p>
<p>It connects via an ethernet connector RJ-45 to the VCC GND and CAN bus of the car</p>
<p>This was a great choice, because the ethernet cables have a small footprint and 8 cables are already bundled toghether</p>

The can2040 project is a software CAN bus implementation for Raspberry
Pi [rp2040](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040/)
micro-controllers.  It enables an rp2040 chip to implement
[CAN bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus) using a standard CAN
transceiver chip.

The code supports reading and writing CAN 2.0B data frames at rates up
to 1Mbit per second.  See the [API document](docs/API.md) for
information on using can2040.  The [tools document](docs/Tools.md)
contains information on developer tools that may be useful.

This is a software implementation of CAN bus.  See the [features
document](docs/Features.md) for details about the implementation.

The [code overview document](docs/Code_Overview.md) provides some
information for developers interested in understanding the internals
of the can2040 code.
